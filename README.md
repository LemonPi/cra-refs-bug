Demonstrate bug

`npm install`

development:

`npm start`

deployment:

`npm run build`

`serve -s build`

In development you'll see a canvas with "You only see this in
development". In deployment you'll see an empty canvas and an error
when you open the developer's console about attaching refs only inside
render().
